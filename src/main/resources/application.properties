spring.application.name=secure-notes

# Spring Security default behavior:
# 1. By default, Spring Security creates a user with username "user".
# 2. A random password is generated at application startup and printed to the console.
# 3. The default login form is shown for all requests.

# Temporary configuration:
# - Override default credentials by setting static username and password.
# - This allows bypassing the random password and using fixed credentials for quick testing.
spring.security.user.name=${USERNAME}
spring.security.user.password=${PASSWORD}
